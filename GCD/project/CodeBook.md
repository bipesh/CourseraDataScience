Description of Data Set

This is summarized tidy data for source dataset from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset. Data column descriptions are as follows:

Subject:  Identifier for the subjects who participated in training and testing activities wearing smartphone 
Activity: These are the six activities carried out by subjects for training and testing activities
            WALKING
            WALKING_UPSTAIRS
            WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
            SITTING
            STANDING
            LAYING
Features Columns: There are 66 mean and standard deviation varibales extracted from feature vector. The feature vector is derived from accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals in X, Y and Z directions; tAcc-XYZ, tGyro-XYZ respectively. 

Variables for the feature vector in each pattern - XYZ are as follows:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables in this tidy data set.
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
